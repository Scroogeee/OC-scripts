## Welcome to the OC-scripts repository

This is where I put all of my scripts for the OpenComputers Minecraft mod.

You can find the open computers mod at [the github repository](https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers) of MightyPirates. \
The docs for open computers can be found [here](https://ocdoc.cil.li/)!
